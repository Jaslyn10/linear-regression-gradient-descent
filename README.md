# linear-regression-gradient-descent
This is a mini - project to understand the working of Linear Regression with Gradient Descent from scratch.

##  What this project demonstrates
- Implementing gradient descent manually (without sklearn)
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Converting scaled weights back to real values
- Plotting regression line vs real data
- Comparing results with sklearn's LinearRegression
- Computing R² score manually

##  Results
- Sklearn Results:
Coefficient (w): 7046.6423
Intercept (b): 58286.5979

GRADIENT DESCENT MODEL:
w_real = 7046.3256
b_real = 58289.1617

- Conclusion: sklearn model gave almost identical values => model training was good.
- R square value from using gradient descent:  0.6544
